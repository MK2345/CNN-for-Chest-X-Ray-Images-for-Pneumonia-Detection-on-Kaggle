# CNN-for-Chest-X-Ray-Images-for-Pneumonia-Detection-on-Kaggle
Kaggle hosts several datasets of chest X-ray images for pneumonia detection using deep learning models. 

### Interpretation: 
The models are very good at detecting pneumonia cases. They are more cautious in classifying normal cases, resulting in a high precision but a lower recall. The models tend to diagnose pneumonia when in doubt, which is often preferred in a medical context to avoid missing cases.

I will train more models with this dataset on occasion to further improve performance.

You will find two CNN models I created in the master branch.
The dataset used for this project can be found at the following link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data
